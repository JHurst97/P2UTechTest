<h2>Notes:</h2>
<p>I had fun writing this program! I figured out a more advanced way to do the conversion rather than just "from GBP to XYZ" (see CalculateResult()). The log file is created automatically in the directory of the project, this could potentially cause R/W issues on end users PC - if this occurs: create log.txt manually and assign it in Form1.cs (line 35). The final requirement I found to be slightly unclear.</p>
<h4>Log.txt example:</h4>
